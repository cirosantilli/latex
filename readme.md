My latex templates.

# table.ods

It is much easier to edit tables in [libreoffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/features/calc/)
or other spreadsheet applications since its much easier to keep things alligned.

Give a lable to every table, and then name the tables as label.ods so that 
corresponding tables can be found afterwards for further editing.
